The redesigned Logz.io interface is here - faster, cleaner, and built to support your entire observability workflow from a single platform.

New Logz.io customers already have access to Open 360 AI. To try it out, reach out to your account manager.

## Why this matters

We’re evolving Logz.io into a unified observability platform. The new Open 360 AI experience is designed to help you:

* Find what you need faster
* Work across Logs, Metrics, Traces, and AI tools without switching contexts
* Reduce time-to-value for onboarding, monitoring, and troubleshooting

## What’s new in the UI

**Platform-first navigation**: Top-level entry points for core observability pillars: Logs, Metrics, Dashboards, Alerts, and AI. This lets you navigate by use case, not telemetry.

**Cleaner layout**: We’ve worked to reduce visual noise and cognitive load, to help you focus on what matters and find what you need faster and easier.

**Streamlined workflows**: Navigation paths mirror real user workflows, such as MTTR reduction and alert response.

## Getting started with the new UI

Open 360 AI is enabled by default for new users and will be gradually introduced to existing accounts. Once it's active, you’ll notice:

* A simplified left navigation panel
* Consistent page layouts across product areas
* Fewer clicks to reach common workflows

## Where to find things

* **Explore** → Unified query and visualization for logs, metrics, and traces

* **Dashboards** → Central hub for all your custom and templated views

* **Alerts** → Configure triggers and notifications

* **AI Assistant** → Ask questions, investigate anomalies, or summarize findings

## Don't have access to Open 360 AI?

Open 360 AI is rolling out gradually. If it’s not yet available in your account and you’d like early access, contact your account manager or reach out to [Logz.io's support team](https://logz.io/support-page/).
