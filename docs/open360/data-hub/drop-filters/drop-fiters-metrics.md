Drop filters offer a great way to filter out metrics from an account to help manage your account volume and lower costs.

Drop filters check if incoming metrics match certain conditions exactly, based on account and metric name. If a metric matches an active drop filter in your account, it wonâ€™t be indexed, it can't be searched, it won't trigger alerts, and it won't show up in dashboards.

To get started with Drop Metrics Filters, navigate to [Data Hub > Drop Filters > Metrics](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/tools/metrics-drop-filters).

The drop filters table lists all your filters, whether they are active or not. Use the filters at the top of the table to view drop filters for specific accounts or metric names.

You can see the condition and state of each filter. You can easily switch any filter on or off whenever you like, and the changes will take effect in about a minute. Hover over a filter to open additional options: **Edit** and **Delete**.
