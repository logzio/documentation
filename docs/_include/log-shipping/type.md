Declare your log type for parsing purposes. Logz.io applies default parsing pipelines to the following list of [built-in log types](https://docs.logz.io/docs/user-guide/data-hub/log-parsing/default-parsing/#built-in-log-types). If you declare another type, contact support for assistance with custom parsing. Can't contain spaces.
