Replace the placeholders to match your specifics. (They are indicated by the double angle brackets `<< >>`):

* Replace `<<LISTENER-HOST>>` with the Logz.io Listener URL [for your region](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html#available-regions), configured to use port **8052** for http traffic, or port **8053** for https traffic. For example, `listener.logz.io` if your account is hosted on AWS US East, or `listener-nl.logz.io` if hosted on Azure West Europe.
* Replace `<<PROMETHEUS-METRICS-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>` with a [token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) for the Metrics account you want to ship to. <br /> Here's how to [look up your Metrics token.](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/finding-your-metrics-account-token/)
