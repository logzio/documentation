This is used for the API cookbooks to tell the user when to replace their API
token or API URL in code samples.

There are two ways to pass it:

Option 1: At the top of the file, to apply to all `<<API-TOKEN>>` and `<<API-URL>>` instances in the page.
Example:

{@include: ../_include/api-cookbook/replace-vars.html}

Option 2: Contextually, just above or below the code block:
Example:

{@include: ../_include/api-cookbook/replace-vars.html}

  ### Variables in this article

  In the code blocks in this article, you'll see `<<API-TOKEN>>` and `<<API-URL>>` variables.
  These need to be replaced with information specific to your account:
  {%- else -%}
  In the code block below:
{%- endcase %}

* Replace `<<API-TOKEN>>` with an [API token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-tokens/api) from the account you want to use
* Replace `<<API-URL>>` with your region's base API URL.
  For more information on finding your account's region, see [Account region](https://docs.logz.io/docs/user-guide/admin/hosting-regions/account-region/).
