id: FPM-data
title: FPM
overview: This integration creates a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that links to your Amazon S3 metrics stream and then sends the metrics to your Logz.io account. It also creates a Lambda function that adds AWS namespaces to the metric stream, and a Lambda function that collects and ships the resources' tags.

FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative PHP FastCGI implementation with some additional features (mostly) useful for heavy-loaded sites. Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems and IoT sensors.

To send your Prometheus-format PHP-FPM metrics to Logz.io, you need to add the **inputs.phpfpm** and **outputs.http** plug-ins to your Telegraf configuration file.

### Configure Telegraf to send your metrics data to Logz.io

 

#### Set up Telegraf v1.17 or higher

{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-setup.md}

#### Add the inputs.PHP-FPM plug-in

First you need to configure the input plug-in to enable Telegraf to scrape the PHP-FPM data from your hosts. To do this, add the following code to the configuration file:

``` ini
[[inputs.phpfpm]]
  ## An array of addresses to gather stats about. Specify an ip or hostname
  ## with optional port and path
  ##
  ## Plugin can be configured in three modes (either can be used):
  ##   - http: the URL must start with http:// or https://, ie:
  ##       "http://localhost/status"
  ##       "http://192.168.130.1/status?full"
  ##
  ##   - unixsocket: path to fpm socket, ie:
  ##       "/var/run/php5-fpm.sock"
  ##      or using a custom fpm status path:
  ##       "/var/run/php5-fpm.sock:fpm-custom-status-path"
  ##      glob patterns are also supported:
  ##       "/var/run/php*.sock"
  ##
  ##   - fcgi: the URL must start with fcgi:// or cgi://, and port must be present, ie:
  ##       "fcgi://10.0.0.12:9000/status"
  ##       "cgi://10.0.10.12:9001/status"
  ##
  ## Example of multiple gathering from local socket and remote host
  ## urls = ["http://192.168.1.20/status", "/tmp/fpm.sock"]
  urls = ["http://localhost/status"]

  ## Duration allowed to complete HTTP requests.
  # timeout = "5s"

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = false
```

:::
 

#### Add the outputs.http plug-in
  
{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-outputs.md}
{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/replace-placeholders-prometheus.html}
  
### Start Telegraf

{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-run.md}

### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).
