cURL is a command line utility for transferring data. cURL is a quick and easy way to test your configuration or troubleshoot your connectivity to Logz.io.

You can upload JSON or plain text files.

## Upload a JSON log file

### Limitations

* Max body size is 10 MB (10,485,760 bytes)
* Each log line must be 500,000 bytes or less
* If you include a `type` field in the log, it overrides `type` in the request header


**Before you begin, you'll need**:
[cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html)


 

### Upload the file

If you want to ship logs from your code but don't have a library in place,
you can send them directly to the Logz.io listener as a minified JSON file.

```shell
cat /path/to/log/file | curl -X POST "https://<<LISTENER-HOST>>:8071?token=<<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>&type=<LOG-TYPE>" -v --data-binary @-
```

{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/replace-placeholders.html}

* {@include: ../../_include/log-shipping/type.md} Otherwise, the default `type` is `http-bulk`.

### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd).

If you still don't see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).

 
## Upload a plain text log file
