cURL is a command line utility for transferring data, useful for testing configurations or troubleshooting connectivity to Logz.io. You can upload JSON or plain text files. 

## Send plain text as a JSON payload

1. Download [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html).

2. To send a single text log line using cURL, use the following command. This sends your message as a JSON payload:

```shell
curl --location 'https://listener.logz.io:8071?token=<<SHIPPING_TOKEN>>&type=text' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{"<<test>>": "<<support>>"}'
```

Replace `<<SHIPPING_TOKEN>>` with your account's shipping token.

:::note
The request body is a list of logs in minified JSON format, with each log separated by a newline (\n).
:::

This method sends a JSON-formatted string, where the text is treated as the log message content.

3. View your logs

Allow some time for data ingestion, then open [Explore](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/explore).




## Upload a JSON log file

**Limitations**

* Max body size: 10 MB (10,485,760 bytes).
* Max log line size: 500,000 bytes.
* Type field in the log overrides the `type` in the request header.

1. Download [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html).

2. Upload the file:


```shell 
cat /path/to/log/file | curl -X POST "https://<<LISTENER-HOST>>:8071?token=<<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>&type=<LOG-TYPE>" \
-H "user-agent:logzio-curl-logs" \
-v --data-binary @-
```

{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/replace-placeholders.html}

* {@include: ../../_include/log-shipping/type.md} Otherwise, the default `type` is `http-bulk`.

## Upload a plain text log file



**Limitations**

curl -T /path/to/log/file https://<<LISTENER-HOST>>:8022/file_upload/<<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>/<<LOG-TYPE>> \
-H "user-agent: logzio-curl-logs"
```

Replace the placeholders to match your specifics. (They are indicated by the double angle brackets `<< >>`):
