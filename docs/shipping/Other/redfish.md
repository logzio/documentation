## Overview

DMTF's Redfish is a standard designed to deliver simple and secure management for converged, hybrid IT and the Software Defined Data Center (SDDC).Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems and IoT sensors.

To send your Prometheus-format Redfish metrics to Logz.io, you need to add the **inputs.redfish** and **outputs.http** plug-ins to your Telegraf configuration file.

#### Configure Telegraf to send your metrics data to Logz.io

 

##### Set up Telegraf v1.17 or higher

{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-setup.md}

##### Add the inputs.Redfish plug-in

First you need to configure the input plug-in to enable Telegraf to scrape the Redfish data from your hosts. To do this, add the following code to the configuration file:

``` ini
[[inputs.redfish]]
  ## Redfish API Base URL.
  address = "https://127.0.0.1:5000"

  ## Credentials for the Redfish API.
  username = "root"
  password = "password123456"

  ## System Id to collect data for in Redfish APIs.
  computer_system_id="System.Embedded.1"

  ## Amount of time allowed to complete the HTTP request
  # timeout = "5s"

  ## Optional TLS Config
  # tls_ca = "/etc/telegraf/ca.pem"
  # tls_cert = "/etc/telegraf/cert.pem"
  # tls_key = "/etc/telegraf/key.pem"
  ## Use TLS but skip chain & host verification
  # insecure_skip_verify = false
```

:::note
The full list of data scraping and configuring options can be found [here](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/release-1.18/plugins/inputs/redfish/README.md)
:::
 

##### Add the outputs.http plug-in
  
{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-outputs.md}
{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/replace-placeholders-prometheus.html}

#### Start Telegraf

{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-run.md}  
  
#### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).
