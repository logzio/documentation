## Manual configuration

Logz.io recommends that you use OpenTelemetry to gather trace transaction data from your system. Because of its versatility, OpenTelemetry has been widely adopted as the industry standard: OpenTelemetry can be equipped with many additional functionalities, one of which is collecting aggregated trace data. Beyond that, [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry) is set to be the best production-ready solution going forward.


This integration includes:

* Installing the OpenTelemetry collector with Logz.io exporter on your application host
* Configuring the collector to receive traces from your Jaeger installation and send them to Logz.io

On deployment, your Jaeger instrumentation captures spans from your application and forwards them to the collector, which exports the data to your Logz.io account.


### Set up your locally hosted Jaeger installation to send traces to Logz.io

**Before you begin, you'll need**:

* An application instrumented with Jaeger
* An active Logz.io account


#### Download and configure OpenTelemetry collector

Create a dedicated directory on the host of your application and download the [OpenTelemetry collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/releases/tag/v0.70.0) that is relevant to the operating system of your host.

 
:::note
This integration uses OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib, not the OpenTelemetry Collector Core.

After downloading the collector, create a configuration file `config.yaml` with the following parameters:

```yaml

  jaeger:

      thrift_compact:
        endpoint: "0.0.0.0:6831"

#### Start the collector

Run the following command:

```shell
<path/to>/otelcontribcol_<VERSION-NAME> --config ./config.yaml
```
* Replace `<path/to>` with the path to the directory where you downloaded the collector.
* Replace `<VERSION-NAME>` with the version name of the collector applicable to your system, e.g. `otelcontribcol_darwin_amd64`.

#### Run the application

Run the application to generate traces.


#### Check Logz.io for your traces

Give your traces some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Tracing](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/jaeger).
