**Before you begin, you'll need**:

* Root access
* Port 5000 open

 

### Run the rsyslog configuration script

{@include: ../../_include/log-shipping/log-shipping-token.html}

{@include: ../../_include/log-shipping/listener-var.html} 

```shell
curl -sLO https://github.com/logzio/logzio-shipper/raw/master/dist/logzio-rsyslog.tar.gz \
  && tar xzf logzio-rsyslog.tar.gz \
  && sudo rsyslog/install.sh -t linux -a "<<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>" -l "<<LISTENER-HOST>>"
```


The above assumes the following defaults:

* Log location - `/var/log/`
* Log type - `syslog`

### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then [open Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd). You can search for `type:syslog` to filter for your logs. 

If you still don't see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
