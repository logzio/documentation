Disque is a distributed message broker. Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems and IoT sensors.

To send your Prometheus-format Disque metrics to Logz.io, you need to add the **inputs.disque** and **outputs.http** plug-ins to your Telegraf configuration file.

### Configure Telegraf to send your metrics data to Logz.io

 

#### Set up Telegraf v1.17 or higher

{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-setup.md}
 
#### Add the inputs.disque plug-in

First you need to configure the input plug-in to enable Telegraf to scrape the Disque data from your hosts. To do this, add the following code to the configuration file:


``` ini
[[inputs.disque]]
  ## An array of URI to gather stats about. Specify an ip or hostname
  ## with optional port and password.
  ## ie disque://localhost, disque://10.10.3.33:18832, 10.0.0.1:10000, etc.
  ## If no servers are specified, then localhost is used as the host.
  servers = ["localhost"]
```

:::note
The database name is only required for instantiating a connection with the server and does not restrict the databases that we collect metrics from. The full list of data scraping and configuring options can be found [here](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/release-1.18/plugins/inputs/disque/README.md).
:::
 

#### Add the outputs.http plug-in

{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-outputs.md}
{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/replace-placeholders-prometheus.html}

### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).
