BigQuery BI Engine is a fast, in-memory analysis service to analyze data stored in BugQuery. 

## Logs
 
{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/gcp-logs.md}   

For this integration, the telemetry list needs to include `bigquery_biengine_model`.

### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd).

## Metrics

{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/gcp-metrics.md}

For this integration, the telemetry list needs to include `bigquerybiengine.googleapis.com`.

### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).
