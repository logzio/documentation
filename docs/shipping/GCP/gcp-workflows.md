Google Workflows is a service to orchestrate and automate Google Cloud and HTTP-based API services. 

{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/gcp-logs.md}

For this integration, the telemetry list needs to include `workflows`.

### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).
