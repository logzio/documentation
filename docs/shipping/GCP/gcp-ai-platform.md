Google AI Platform is a suite of services on Google Cloud specifically targeted at building, deploying, and managing machine learning models in the cloud.

## Logs

### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd).

## Metrics
