Google Firestore is a NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application development. 

## Logs

{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/gcp-logs.md}   

For this integration, the telemetry list needs to include `firestore`.

### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd).

## Metrics

{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/gcp-metrics.md}

For this integration, the telemetry list needs to include `firestore.googleapis.com`.

### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).
