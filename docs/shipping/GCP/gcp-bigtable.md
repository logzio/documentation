Google Cloud Bigtable is a high performance NoSQL database service for large analytical and operational workloads. 

## Logs

For this integration, the telemetry list needs to include `bigquery_table`.


### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd).

## Metrics

{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/gcp-metrics.md}

For this integration, the telemetry list needs to include `bigtable.googleapis.com`.

### Check Logz.io for your metrics
