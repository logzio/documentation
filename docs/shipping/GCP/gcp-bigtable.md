Google Cloud Bigtable is a high performance NoSQL database service for large analytical and operational workloads. 


{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/gcp-logs.md}  

For this integration, the telemetry list needs to include `bigquery_table`.


### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).
