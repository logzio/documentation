This integration allows you to send logs from your network devices to your Logz.io account. 

**Before you begin, you'll need**:

* [Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation.html) installed
* Root access

 

### Configure your device

Configure your network device to send logs to your Filebeat server, TCP port 9000.
See your device's documentation if you're not sure how to do this.

{@include: ../../_include/log-shipping/certificate.md}

### Add TCP traffic as an input

In the Filebeat configuration file (/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml), add TCP to the filebeat.inputs section.

{@include: ../../_include/log-shipping/log-shipping-token.html}

{@include: ../../_include/log-shipping/filebeat-input-extension.md}


```yaml
# ...
filebeat.inputs:
- type: tcp
  max_message_size: 10MiB
  host: "0.0.0.0:9000"

  fields:
    logzio_codec: plain

    # You can manage your tokens at
    # https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-tokens/log-shipping
    token: <<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>
    type: network-device
  fields_under_root: true
  encoding: utf-8
  ignore_older: 3h
```


### Set Logz.io as the output 

If Logz.io is not an output, add it now.
Remove all other outputs.

{@include: ../../_include/log-shipping/listener-url.html} 

```yaml
# ...
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["<<LISTENER-HOST>>:5015"]
  ssl:
    certificate_authorities: ['/etc/pki/tls/certs/COMODORSADomainValidationSecureServerCA.crt']
```

### Start Filebeat

[Start or restart Filebeat](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/master/filebeat-starting.html) for the changes to take effect.


### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd).

If you still don't see your logs, see [Filebeat troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/docs/user-guide/log-management/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-filebeat/).
