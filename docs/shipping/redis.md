Redis is an in-memory data structure store, used as a distributed, in-memory key–value database, cache and message broker, with optional durability. Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems and IoT sensors.

To send your Prometheus-format Redis metrics to Logz.io, you need to add the **inputs.redis** and **outputs.http** plug-ins to your Telegraf configuration file.

<!-- logzio-inject:install:grafana:dashboards ids=["1sS7i6SyMz35RIay8NRYGp"] -->

#### Configure Telegraf to send your metrics data to Logz.io



##### Set up Telegraf v1.17 or higher

{@include: ../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-setup.md}

##### Add the inputs.redis plug-in

First you need to configure the input plug-in to enable Telegraf to scrape the Redis data from your hosts. To do this, add the following code to the configuration file:


``` ini
[[inputs.redis]]
  ##  specify servers via a url matching:
     servers = [<<PROTOCOL>>://][:<<PASSWORD>>]@<<ADDRESS>>[:<<PORT>>]
  ##  e.g.
  ##    tcp://localhost:6379
  ##    tcp://:password@192.168.99.100
  ##    servers = ["tcp://20.77.110.14:6379","tcp://20.77.110.32:6379"]
```

* Replace `<<PROTOCOL>>` with the name of your shipping protocol (tcp protocol recommended).
* Replace `<<PASSWORD>>` with the password for your Redis database.
* Replace `<<ADDRESS>>` with the address of your Redis database host. This is `localhost` if installed locally.
* Replace `<<PORT>>` with the address of your host port allocated to Redis database.

:::note
The full list of data scraping and configuring options can be found [here](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/release-1.18/plugins/inputs/redis/README.md).

##### Add the outputs.http plug-in

{@include: ../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-outputs.md}
{@include: ../_include/general-shipping/replace-placeholders-prometheus.html}

#### Start Telegraf

{@include: ../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-run.md}

#### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your metrics some time to get from your system to ours.


{@include: ../_include/metric-shipping/custom-dashboard.html} Install the pre-built dashboard to enhance the observability of your metrics.
