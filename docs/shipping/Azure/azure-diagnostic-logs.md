## Setting up Log Shipping from Azure

### Deploy the Logz.io Python TemplateðŸ‘‡ 

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flogzio%2Fazure-serverless%2Fmaster%2Fdeployments%2Fazuredeploylogs.json)


This deployment will create the following services:
* Serverless Function App (Python-based)
* Event Hubs Namespace
* Event Hubs Instance
* Storage account: 
  - Function's logs containers
  - Failed shipments logs container
* App Service Plan
* Log Analytics Workspace
* Application Insights

### Configure the Template

Use these settings when configuring the template:

| Parameter       | Description                                                             |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Resource group* | Create a new resource group or select an existing one.                  |
| Region*         | Select the region closest to your Azure services.                       |
| LogzioURL*      | Select a predefined listener URL for your region, or choose CUSTOM to specify your own. |
| CustomLogzioURL | Custom listener URL (e.g., https://listener-custom.logz.io:8071). Required only when LogzioURL is set to CUSTOM. |
| UseKeyVaultForToken | If true, read LogzioToken from an existing Key Vault secret reference (default: false). |
| LogzioTokenSecretUri | Full Key Vault Secret URI (prefer versioned), e.g., https://kv-name.vault.azure.net/secrets/secret-name/version. Required when UseKeyVaultForToken is true. |
| KeyVaultResourceId | Resource ID of the existing Key Vault, e.g., /subscriptions/sub-id/resourceGroups/rg-name/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/kv-name. Required when UseKeyVaultForToken is true. |
| LogzioToken     | Your Logz.io logs shipping token. Leave empty if UseKeyVaultForToken is true. |
| ThreadCount     | Number of threads for the Function App (default: 4).                    |
| bufferSize      | Maximum number of messages to accumulate before sending (default: 100). |
| intervalTime    | Interval time for sending logs in milliseconds (default: 10000).        |
| maxTries        | The maximum number of retries for the backoff mechanism (default: 3).   |
| logType         | The type of the logs being processed (default: eventHub).               |


*Required fields (LogzioURL and Region are always required; either LogzioToken OR the Key Vault parameters are required).

After setting the parameters, click **Review + Create**, and then **Create** to deploy.

#### Using Azure Key Vault for Token Storage

For enhanced security, you can store your Logz.io token in an existing Azure Key Vault instead of providing it directly as a parameter:

* **Prerequisites**:
   - An existing Azure Key Vault with your Logz.io logs token stored as a secret
   - The deploying user/service principal must have permissions to assign roles on the Key Vault (e.g., "User Access Administrator" or "Owner" role)

* ***Configuration**:
   - Set `UseKeyVaultForToken` to `true`
   - Provide the `LogzioTokenSecretUri` (full secret URI, preferably versioned for deterministic behavior)
   - Provide the `KeyVaultResourceId` (full resource ID of your Key Vault)
   - Leave `LogzioToken` empty

* ***What happens during deployment**:
   - The Function App is created with a system-assigned managed identity
   - The managed identity is automatically granted the "Key Vault Secrets User" role on your Key Vault
   - The Function App's `LogzioToken` setting is configured as a Key Vault reference

* ***Example values**:
   ```
   UseKeyVaultForToken: true
   LogzioTokenSecretUri: https://my-keyvault.vault.azure.net/secrets/logzio-token/abc123def456
   KeyVaultResourceId: /subscriptions/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789abc/resourceGroups/my-rg/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/my-keyvault
   LogzioToken: "" # leave empty when using Key Vault
   ```

#### Using Custom Listener URLs

If your Logz.io account uses a custom listener URL not available in the predefined list:

- **ARM Template**: Select "CUSTOM" from the `LogzioURL` dropdown, then provide your full custom URL in the `CustomLogzioURL` field (e.g., `https://listener-custom.logz.io:8071`).

- **Terraform**: Set the `logzio_url` variable directly to your custom URL in your `.tfvars` file.


### Stream Azure Service Data

Configure your Azure services to stream logs to the newly created Event Hub. For each service:

1. Create diagnostic settings.
2. Under **Event hub policy name**, select the appropriate policy (e.g., 'RootManageSharedAccessKey').

For more details, see [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitor-stream-monitoring-data-event-hubs).

#### Verify Data Reception in Logz.io

Allow some time for data to flow from Azure to Logz.io, then check your Logz.io account. You should see logs of the type `eventHub` in Logz.io.

#### Backup for Unshipped Logs

The deployment includes a backup mechanism for logs that fail to ship to Logz.io. By default, these logs are stored in the **failedlogbackup** blob container, but this can be customized to a different container name of your choice during the setup process.

#### Post-Deployment Configuration

To modify configuration after deployment, visit your Function App's **Configuration** tab. You can adjust settings such as `LogzioURL`, `LogzioToken`, `bufferSize`, and more.

### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, and then open your [Logz.io Open Search Dashboards account](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd/discover?).
If everything went according to plan, you should see logs of the `type:eventHub` in Open Search Dashboards.

If you still donâ€™t see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/docs/user-guide/log-management/troubleshooting/log-shipping-troubleshooting/).


## Alternative Setup using Terraform

As an alternative to the Azure Template, you can use Terraform to set up your log shipping environment. The Terraform configuration files are located in the **deployments** folder of this repository. Follow the instructions below to deploy this integration using Terraform.

### Prerequisites

- Terraform installed on your local machine.
- Azure CLI installed and configured with your Azure account credentials.

### Steps to Deploy using Terraform

1. **Obtain the Terraform Configuration**: Use curl to download only the `azuredeploylogs.tf` and `variables.tf` files from the GitHub repository.

   ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logzio/azure-serverless/master/deployments/azuredeploylogs.tf \
   &&
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logzio/azure-serverless/master/deployments/variables.tf
   ```

2. **Create a `.tfvars` File**: Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the same folder to specify your configurations, such as your Logz.io token.
    ```hcl
    logzio_url = "https://<<LISTENER-HOST>>:8071" # Replace with your actual listener URL
    logzio_token = "<<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>"
    thread_count = 4
    buffer_size = 100
    interval_time = 10000
    max_tries = 3
    log_type = "eventHub"
   
3. **Initialize Terraform**: Run the Terraform initialization to install the necessary plugins.
   ```bash
    terraform init
   ```

4. **Apply Terraform Configuration**: Deploy the infrastructure using `terraform apply`. You will be prompted to review the proposed changes before applying the configuration.
   ```bash
    terraform apply
   ```
    Type **yes** when prompted to confirm the deployment.
5. **Verify Deployment**: After successful application of the Terraform configuration, your Azure services will be set up and ready for log shipping.


### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, and then open your [Logz.io Open Search Dashboards account](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd/discover?).
If everything went according to plan, you should see logs of the `type:eventHub` in Open Search Dashboards.

If you still donâ€™t see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/docs/user-guide/log-management/troubleshooting/log-shipping-troubleshooting/).

### Migration to Log Analytics Workspace-Based Model

For users currently on the Classic Application Insights, it's essential to migrate to the Log Analytics workspace-based model. To do this:

1. Navigate to your Application Insights resource that hasn't been migrated yet.
2. Click on the notification that states "Classic Application Insights is deprecated."
3. A "Migrate to Workspace-based" dialog will appear. Here, confirm your preferred Log Analytics Workspace and click 'Apply'.

:::caution important
Be aware that once you migrate to a workspace-based model, the process cannot be reversed.
