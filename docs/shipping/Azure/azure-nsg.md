Enable an Azure function to forward NSG logs from your Azure Blob Storage account to your Logz.io account.


**Before you begin, you'll need**: 

* An Azure Blob Storage account of the type **StorageV2 (general purpose v2)** dedicated to NSG logs and called **Logzio_NSG_BLOB**
* A virtual machine instance in Azure resource group connected to the storage account
* Network Watcher enabled in the region of the virtual machine

 

### Configure the NSG flow to your Azure Blob Storage account

#### Register Insights provider

1. Log in to the Azure Portal.
2. Navigate to **All services > Subscriptions**.
3. Select the subscription that the Azure resource group belongs to.
4. Select **Settings > Resource providers**.
5. Make sure that **Status** for the **microsoft.insights** provider is set to **Registered**. If not, set it to **Registered**.
  

#### Enable NSG flow log
   
1. For your VM, navigate to **Networking > NSG > NSG flow**.
2. From the list of NSGs, select the NSG with the name of your VM.
3. Set the **Flow logs** status to **on**.
4. Select the required **Flow logs version**.
5. In the **Storage accound** field, select the Logzio_NSG_BLOB Azure Blob Storage account.
6. Select the required retention period.
7. If required, enable the **Traffic Analytics**.
8. Save the configuration.

### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd). You can filter for logs of `type` `azure_blob_trigger` to see the incoming logs.
  
If you still donâ€™t see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
