Extensions are small applications that provide post-deployment configuration and automation on Azure VMs. You can install Logz.io agents on Azure virtual machines as an extension. This will allow you to ship logs directly from your VM to your Logz.io account.

* An active Logz.io account.
* Resource group created under your Logz.io account in Azure.
  
  
### Login to Logz.io from your Azure account
  
Log in to Logz.io using either the SSO in your Azure account or a link to the Logz.io platform.
  
If SSO is enabled for Logz.io in Azure:
