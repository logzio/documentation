Riak is a distributed NoSQL key-value data store that offers high availability, fault tolerance, operational simplicity, and scalability.  Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems and IoT sensors.

To send your Prometheus-format Riak metrics to Logz.io, you need to add the **inputs.riak** and **outputs.http** plug-ins to your Telegraf configuration file.

#### Configure Telegraf to send your metrics data to Logz.io

 

##### Set up Telegraf v1.17 or higher

{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-setup.md}

##### Add the inputs.Riak plug-in

First you need to configure the input plug-in to enable Telegraf to scrape the Riak data from your hosts. To do this, add the following code to the configuration file:

``` ini
[[inputs.riak]]
  # Specify a list of one or more riak http servers
  servers = ["http://localhost:8098"]
```

:::note
The full list of data scraping and configuring options can be found [here](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/release-1.18/plugins/inputs/riak/README.md)
:::
 

##### Add the outputs.http plug-in
  
{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-outputs.md}
{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/replace-placeholders-prometheus.html}

#### Start Telegraf

{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-run.md}

#### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).
