## Overview

PgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL. Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems and IoT sensors.

To send your Prometheus-format PgBouncer metrics to Logz.io, you need to add the **inputs.pgbouncer** and **outputs.http** plug-ins to your Telegraf configuration file.

**Before you begin, you'll need**: PgBouncer

#### Configure Telegraf to send your metrics data to Logz.io

 

##### Set up Telegraf v1.17 or higher

**Ubuntu & Debian**

```shell
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install telegraf
```

The configuration file is located at `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf`.

**RedHat and CentOS**

```shell
sudo yum install telegraf
```

The configuration file is located at `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf`.

**SLES & openSUSE**

```shell
# add go repository
zypper ar -f obs://devel:languages:go/ go
# install latest telegraf
zypper in telegraf
```

The configuration file is located at `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf`.

**FreeBSD/PC-BSD**

```shell
sudo pkg install telegraf
```

The configuration file is located at `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf`.
  
##### Add the inputs.pgbouncer plug-in

First you need to configure the input plug-in to enable Telegraf to scrape the PgBouncer data from your hosts. To do this, add the following code to the configuration file:


``` ini
[[inputs.pgbouncer]]
  ## specify address via a url matching:
  ##   postgres://[pqgotest[:password]]@host:port[/dbname]\
  ##       ?sslmode=[disable|verify-ca|verify-full]
  ## or a simple string:
  ##   host=localhost port=5432 user=pqgotest password=... sslmode=... dbname=app_production
  ##
  ## All connection parameters are optional.
  ##
  address = "host=localhost user=pgbouncer sslmode=disable"
```


:::note
The database name is only required for instantiating a connection with the server and does not restrict the databases that we collect metrics from. The full list of data scraping and configuring options can be found [here](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/release-1.18/plugins/inputs/pgbouncer/README.md).

##### Add the outputs.http plug-in

{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-outputs.md}
{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/replace-placeholders-prometheus.html}

##### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).
