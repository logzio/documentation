TeamCity is a general-purpose CI/CD solution that allows the most flexibility for all sorts of workflows and development practices.  Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems and IoT sensors.

To send your Prometheus-format TeamCity metrics to Logz.io, you need to add the **inputs.prometheus** and **outputs.http** plug-ins to your Telegraf configuration file.

<!-- logzio-inject:install:grafana:dashboards ids=["1mdHqslZMi4gXaNCLZo9G1"] -->

### Configure Telegraf to send your metrics data to Logz.io



#### Set up Telegraf v1.17 or higher

{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-setup.md}

#### Add the inputs.prometheus plug-in

First you need to configure the input plug-in to enable Telegraf to scrape the TeamCity data from your hosts. To do this, add the following code to the configuration file:

``` ini
[[inputs.prometheus]]

  urls = ["https://<TeamCity_server_URL>/app/metrics?experimental=true"]

  ## Optional HTTP Basic Auth Credentials
  username = “<YOUR-USERNAME>”
  password = “<YOUR-PASSWORD>” 
```

* Replace `<TeamCity_server_URL>` with the URL of your TeamCity server.
* Replace `<YOUR-USERNAME>` with the user name to your TeamCity server.
* Replace `<YOUR-PASSWORD>` with the password to your TeamCity server.


#### Add the outputs.http plug-in

{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-outputs.md}
{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/replace-placeholders-prometheus.html}

### Start Telegraf

{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-run.md}

### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your metrics some time to get from your system to ours.

Install the pre-built dashboard to enhance the observability of your metrics.
