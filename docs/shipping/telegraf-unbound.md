overview: This integration creates a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that links to your Amazon S3 metrics stream and then sends the metrics to your Logz.io account. It also creates a Lambda function that adds AWS namespaces to the metric stream, and a Lambda function that collects and ships the resources' tags.

## Overview

Unbound is a crowdfunding publisher that gives people the tools, support and freedom to bring their ideas to life. Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems and IoT sensors.

To send your Prometheus-format Unbound metrics to Logz.io, you need to add the **inputs.unbound** and **outputs.http** plug-ins to your Telegraf configuration file.

#### Configuring Telegraf to send your metrics data to Logz.io

 

##### Set up Telegraf v1.17 or higher

{@include: ../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-setup.md}

##### Add the inputs.unbound plug-in

First you need to configure the input plug-in to enable Telegraf to scrape the Unbound data from your hosts. To do this, add the following code to the configuration file:

``` ini
[[inputs.unbound]]
  ## Address of server to connect to, read from unbound conf default, optionally ':port'
  ## Will lookup IP if given a hostname
  server = "127.0.0.1:8953"

  ## If running as a restricted user you can prepend sudo for additional access:
  # use_sudo = false

  ## The default location of the unbound-control binary can be overridden with:
  # binary = "/usr/sbin/unbound-control"

  ## The default location of the unbound config file can be overridden with:
  # config_file = "/etc/unbound/unbound.conf"

  ## The default timeout of 1s can be overridden with:
  # timeout = "1s"

  ## When set to true, thread metrics are tagged with the thread id.
  ##
  ## The default is false for backwards compatibility, and will be changed to
  ## true in a future version.  It is recommended to set to true on new
  ## deployments.
  thread_as_tag = false
```

##### Add the outputs.http plug-in
  
{@include: ../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-outputs.md}
{@include: ../_include/general-shipping/replace-placeholders-prometheus.html}
  
##### Start Telegraf

{@include: ../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-run.md}


##### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).
