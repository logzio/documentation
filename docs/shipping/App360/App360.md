[App360](https://docs.logz.io/docs/user-guide/distributed-tracing/spm/) is a high-level monitoring dashboard within Logz.io that enables you to monitor your operations. This integration allows you to configure the OpenTelemetry collector to send data from your OpenTelemetry installation to Logz.io using App360. 




## Architecture overview

This integration is based on OpenTelemetry and includes configuring the OpenTelemetry collector to receive data generated by your application instrumentation and send it to Logz.io using App360

On deployment, your OpenTelemetry instrumentation captures data from your application and forwards it to the collector, which exports the spans and metrics data to your Logz.io account using App360.

:::note
This integration uses OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib, not the OpenTelemetry Collector Core.
:::






## Set up your locally hosted OpenTelemetry

**Before you begin, you'll need**:

* An application instrumented with an OpenTelemetry instrumentation or any other supported instrumentations based on OpenTracing, Zipkin or Jaeger 
* An active Logz.io account
* A Logz.io metrics account 


### Configure OpenTelemetry collector

#### Get the collector

You can either download the OpenTelemetry collector to your local host or run the collector as a Docker container.

##### Download locally

Create a dedicated directory on the host of your application and download the [OpenTelemetry collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/releases) that is relevant to the operating system of your host.

##### Run as a Docker container

In the same Docker network as your application:

```shell
docker pull otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.105.0
```

:::note
This integration only works with a contrib image.

By default, this configuration collects all traces that have a span completed with an error, all traces that are slower than 1000 ms, and 10% of the remaining traces. 

You can add more policy configurations to the processor. For more on this, refer to [OpenTelemetry Documentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/processor/tailsamplingprocessor/README.md).

The configurable parameters in the Logz.io default configuration are:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| threshold_ms | Threshold for the span latency - all traces slower than the threshold value will be filtered in. | 1000 |
| sampling_percentage | Sampling percentage for the probabilistic policy. | 10 |


If you already have an OpenTelemetry installation, add to the configuration file of your existing OpenTelemetry collector the parameters described in the next steps.
  



### Start the collector

#### Locally running collector

Run the following command:

```shell
<path/to>/otelcontribcol_<VERSION-NAME> --config ./config.yaml
```

* Replace `<path/to>` with the path to the directory where you downloaded the collector.
* Replace `<VERSION-NAME>` with the version name of the collector applicable to your system, e.g. `otelcontribcol_darwin_amd64`.



#### Containerized collector

Mount the `config.yaml` as volume to the `docker run` command and run it as follows.

##### Linux

```
docker run  \
--network host \
-v <PATH-TO>/config.yaml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml \
otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.105.0

```

Replace `<PATH-TO>` to the path to the `config.yaml` file on your system.

##### Windows

```
docker run  \
-v <PATH-TO>/config.yaml:/etc/otelcol-contrib/config.yaml \
-p 55678-55680:55678-55680 \
-p 1777:1777 \
-p 9411:9411 \
-p 9943:9943 \
-p 6831:6831 \
-p 6832:6832 \
-p 14250:14250 \
-p 14268:14268 \
-p 4317:4317 \
-p 55681:55681 \
otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.105.0
```
  
  
##### Optional parameters

If required, you can add the following optional parameters as environment variables when running the container:
  
| Parameter | Description | 
|---|---|
| LATENCY_HISTOGRAM_BUCKETS | Comma separated list of durations defining the latency histogram buckets. Default: `2ms`, `8ms`, `50ms`, `100ms`, `200ms`, `500ms`, `1s`, `5s`, `10s`   | 
| SPAN_METRICS_DIMENSIONS | Each metric will have at least the following dimensions that are common across all spans: `Service name`, `Operation`, `Span kind`, `Status code`. The input is comma separated list of dimensions to add together with the default dimensions, for example: `region,http.url`. Each additional dimension is defined by a name from the span's collection of attributes or resource attributes. If the named attribute is missing in the span, this dimension will be omitted from the metric.   | 
| SPAN_METRICS_DIMENSIONS_CACHE_SIZE | The maximum items number of `metric_key_to_dimensions_cache`. Default: `10000`. | 
| AGGREGATION_TEMPORALITY | Defines the aggregation temporality of the generated metrics. One of either `cumulative` or `delta`. Default: `cumulative`. | 

  
### Run the application

{@include: ../../_include/tracing-shipping/collector-run-note.md}


Run the application to generate traces.



### Check Logz.io for your data

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [App360](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/spm/services/table?start=now-1h&end=now).

## Kubernetes

:::note
Please note that running the Telemetry Collector for Kubernetes (k8s) is a separate use case, which is covered in detail in the specific section dedicated to the [Telemetry Collector for Kubernetes](/docs/user-guide/telemetry-collector).
