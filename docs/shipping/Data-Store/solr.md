## Overview

   is an open-source enterprise-search platform, written in Java. Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems and IoT sensors.

To send your Prometheus-format Apache Solr metrics to Logz.io, you need to add the **inputs.solr** and **outputs.http** plug-ins to your Telegraf configuration file.

#### Configure Telegraf to send your metrics data to Logz.io

 

##### Set up Telegraf v1.17 or higher

{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-setup.md}

##### Add the inputs.solr plug-in

First you need to configure the input plug-in to enable Telegraf to scrape the Apache Solr data from your hosts. To do this, add the following code to the configuration file:

``` ini
[[inputs.solr]]
  ## specify a list of one or more Solr servers
  servers = ["http://localhost:8983"]
  ##
  ## specify a list of one or more Solr cores (default - all)
  # cores = ["main"]
  ##
  ## Optional HTTP Basic Auth Credentials
  # username = "username"
  # password = "pa$$word"
```

:::note
The full list of data scraping and configuring options can be found [here](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/blob/release-1.18/plugins/inputs/solr/README.md)
::: 
 

##### Add the outputs.http plug-in
  
{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-outputs.md}
{@include: ../../_include/general-shipping/replace-placeholders-prometheus.html}
  
#### Start Telegraf

{@include: ../../_include/metric-shipping/telegraf-run.md}

#### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your data some time to get from your system to ours, then log in to your Logz.io Metrics account, and open [the Logz.io Metrics tab](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics/).
