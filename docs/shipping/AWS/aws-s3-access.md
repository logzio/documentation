Amazon S3 Access Logs provide detailed records about requests that are made to your S3 bucket. This integration allows you to send these logs to your Logz.io account.

## Configuration

**Before you begin, you'll need**:

* `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:GetObject` [permissions](https://docs.logz.io/docs/user-guide/admin/give-aws-access-with-iam-roles/) for the required S3 bucket

* {@include: ../../_include/log-shipping/s3-bucket-file-order.md}

 

### Send your logs to an S3 bucket

Logz.io fetches your S3 access logs from a separate S3 bucket.
By default, S3 access logs are not enabled, so you'll need to set this up.

For help with this, see [Amazon S3 Server Access Logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ServerLogs.html) from AWS.


### Add a new S3 bucket using the dedicated Logz.io configuration wizard

{@include: ../../_include/log-shipping/app_login.html}


<!-- logzio-inject:aws:s3-access -->


{@include: ../../_include/log-shipping/add-s3-bucket.md}


### Check Logz.io for your logs  

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd).

If you still don't see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/docs/user-guide/log-management/troubleshooting/log-shipping-troubleshooting/).
