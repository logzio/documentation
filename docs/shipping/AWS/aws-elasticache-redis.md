:::note
For a much easier and more efficient way to collect and send metrics, consider using the [Logz.io telemetry collector](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/integrations/collectors?tags=Quick%20Setup).
:::




Deploy this integration to send your Amazon ElastiCache for Redis metrics to Logz.io.

This integration creates a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that links to your Amazon ElastiCache for Redis metrics stream and then sends the metrics to your Logz.io account. It also creates a Lambda function that adds AWS namespaces to the metric stream, and a Lambda function that collects and ships the resources' tags.

Install the pre-built dashboard to enhance the observability of your metrics.
