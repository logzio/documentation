:::note
For a much easier and more efficient way to collect and send telemetry, consider using the [Logz.io telemetry collector](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/integrations/collectors?tags=Quick%20Setup).

## Configure AWS to forward logs to Logz.io

This integration uses Fluentd in a Docker container to forward logs from your Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster to Logz.io.

:::note
This integration refers to an EC2-based cluster. For Fargate-based cluster see [our Fargate documentation](https://docs.logz.io/shipping/log-sources/fargate.html).
:::
 

:::caution Important
Fluentd will fetch all existing logs, as it is not able to ignore older logs.

**Give your stack a few moments to launch.**

#### Run the task

1. Go to your AWS ECS page, and on the left menu, click on **Task Definitions**, then choose the task you just created.

2. Click on the **Actions** button, then choose **Run Task**.

3. In the **Run Task** screen, choose **EC2** as your **Launch type**.

4. Choose the cluster you want to ship logs from.

5. For **Placement Templates** choose **One Task Per Host**.

6. Click on **Run Task**.

#### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd).
  

### Manual deployment (AWS Classic Console)

 
#### Download the task definition JSON

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/logzio/logzio-aws-ecs/master/task-definition.json

#### Configure the task

In your prefered text editor, open the JSON you downloaded in the previous step and replace the following:

| Paramater | Details |
|---|---|
| `<<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>` | **Required**. Your Logz.io account token. Replace with the [token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/general) of the account you want to ship to. |
| `<<LISTENER-HOST>>` | **Required**. Your Logz.io listener URL. Replace with your region's listener URL.|


#### Advanced settings (optional)

Since the Docker image is based on Logz.io's [fluentd-docker-logs](https://github.com/logzio/fluentd-docker-logs) image, any of the environment variables mentioned [here](https://github.com/logzio/fluentd-docker-logs#parameters) can be added to the task definition JSON.


#### Add your task definition

1. In your [Amazon ECS Classic Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/) menu, go to **Task Definitions** and click on **Create new Task Definition**.

2. In the **Step 1: Select launch type compatibility** screen, choose **EC2** and click **Next step**.

## Configure AWS to forward metrics to Logz.io


Deploy this integration to send your Amazon ECS metrics to Logz.io.

This integration creates a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream that links to your Amazon ECS metrics stream and then sends the metrics to your Logz.io account. It also creates a Lambda function that adds AWS namespaces to the metric stream, and a Lambda function that collects and ships the resources' tags.

Install the pre-built dashboard to enhance the observability of your metrics.
