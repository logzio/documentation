Deploy this integration to auto-instrument your Go application running on AWS Lambda and send the traces to your Logz.io account. This is done by adding a dedicated layer for OpenTelemetry collector and configuring environment variables of these layer. This integration will require no change to your application code.

:::note
This integration only works for the following AWS regions: `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`, `us-west-1`, `us-west-2`,
               `ap-south-1`, `ap-northeast-3`, `ap-northeast-2`, `ap-southeast-1`, `ap-southeast-2`, `ap-northeast-1`,
               `eu-central-1`, `eu-west-1`, `eu-west-2`, `eu-west-3`, `eu-north-1`,
               `sa-east-1`,
               `ca-central-1`.
:::

**Before you begin, you'll need**:
  
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
* Configured [AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
* A Lambda function with Go application that is not yet instrumented.

:::note
Using `aws lambda update-function-configuration` with `--layers` replaces all existing layers with the specified ARN(s). To add a new layer without removing existing ones, include all desired layer ARNs in the command, both new and previously attached.
:::

:::note
Adding environmental variables using the AWS CLI commands below, will overwrite all existing variables for your Lambda function.
:::

:::note
This integration uses OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib, not the OpenTelemetry Collector Core.

#### Add the OpenTelemetry collector layer to your Lambda function 

This layer contains the OpenTelemetry collector that will capture data from your application.

```shell
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <<YOUR-LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME>> --layers arn:aws:lambda:<<YOUR-AWS-REGION>>:486140753397:layer:logzio-opentelemetry-collector-<<ARCHITECHTURE>>-0_1_0:1
```

Replace `<<YOUR-LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME>>` with the name of your Lambda function running the Go application.

Replace `<<YOUR-AWS-REGION>>` with the code of your AWS regions, e.g. `us-east-1`.

Replace `<<ARCHITECTURE>>` with the target architecture for your Lambda function, either `arm64` for ARM-based applications or `amd64` (also known as x86_64) for traditional 64-bit Intel/AMD applications.


#### Create a configuration file for the OpenTelemetry collector
  
By default, the OpenTelemetry collector layer exports data to the Lambda console. To customize the collector configuration, you need to add a `collector.yaml` to your function and specifiy its location via the `OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.


The `collector.yaml` file will have the following configuration:
  
```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: "0.0.0.0:4317"
      http:
        endpoint: "0.0.0.0:4318"

exporters:
  logzio/traces:
    account_token: "<<TRACING-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>"
    region: "<<LOGZIO_ACCOUNT_REGION_CODE>>"

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      exporters: [logzio/traces]
```

  
{@include: ../../_include/tracing-shipping/replace-tracing-token.html}
{@include: ../../_include/tracing-shipping/tail-sampling.md}

 
#### Direct the OpenTelemetry collector to the configuration file


Add `OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_CONFIG_FILE` variable to direct the OpenTelemetry collector to the configuration file:

```
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <<YOUR-LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME>> --environment Variables={OPENTELEMETRY_COLLECTOR_CONFIG_FILE=<<PATH_TO_YOUR_COLLECTOR.YAML>>}
```

Replace `<<YOUR-LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME>>` with the name of your Lambda function running the Go application.

Replace `<<PATH_TO_YOUR_COLLECTOR.YAML>>` with the actual path to your `collector.yaml` file. 
(If `collector.yaml` is located in the root directory of your application, use the path `/var/task/collector.yaml`.)


#### Activate tracing for your Lambda function

```shell
aws lambda update-function-configuration --function-name <<YOUR-LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME>> --tracing-config Mode=Active
```

Replace `<<YOUR-LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME>>` with the name of your Lambda function running the Go application.

## Example: Manual Instrumentation for Go Lambda Functions
Below is a simple example that demonstrates how to instrument a Go-based AWS Lambda function using OpenTelemetry:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/otlp/otlptrace/otlptracegrpc"
	sdktrace "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace"
	"log"
)

// handler is your Lambda function handler
func handler(ctx context.Context, event any) (string, error) {
	log.Println("Starting function")
	// Configure the OTLP exporter to send traces to an OpenTelemetry Collector
	exporter, err := otlptrace.New(ctx, otlptracegrpc.NewClient(
		otlptracegrpc.WithEndpoint("localhost:4317"), // Replace with your collector endpoint
		otlptracegrpc.WithInsecure(),
	))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to create OTLP trace exporter: %v", err)
	}

	// Set up a trace provider with a batch span processor and the OTLP exporter
	tp := sdktrace.NewTracerProvider(
		sdktrace.WithBatcher(exporter),
	)
	otel.SetTracerProvider(tp)
	// Create a tracer
	tracer := tp.Tracer("example-tracer")

	// Start a span
	_, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "lambda-example-span")
	// Your Lambda logic here
	log.Println("Handling event", span)
	span.End()
	tp.ForceFlush(ctx)
	return "Event handled successfully", nil
}

func main() {
	lambda.Start(handler)
}
```
This example manually sets up OpenTelemetry tracing within a Go Lambda function, configuring the OTLP exporter to send traces to an OpenTelemetry Collector. Remember to replace `localhost:4317` with the actual endpoint of your collector.
