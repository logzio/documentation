Use Event Management to monitor the events triggered by your alerts.

Event Management provides a centralized, comprehensive view of the alerts triggered within your environment. This tool allows you to track alert activity, update statuses, add comments and additional details, and prioritize issue handling effectively.

Events are displayed in a sortable table, allowing you to organize them by severity, status, assigned handler, last trigger data, and the most recent update or edit. Additionally, you can filter and search the events to refine your results and focus on the most critical issues.





## Event Management table overview
