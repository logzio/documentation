<h2 id="why">Why use Logz.io Dashboards?</h2>

Logz.io Dashboards provide centralized visibility, streamlined workflows, and deep insight across your telemetry data.
Whether you’re monitoring infrastructure health, investigating issues, or optimizing usage, dashboards make it easier to:

* Visualize logs, metrics, and traces in one unified view
* Customize layouts to highlight what matters most
* Collaborate efficiently with shared dashboards and common views
* Accelerate root cause analysis using AI-powered context

Built with flexible querying and visualization options, dashboards let teams move quickly from high-level overviews to detailed investigations—without context switching.

<h2 id="which">Which visualization can I create?</h2>

Dashboards support a variety of panel types designed for different use cases, including:

* Time Series Chart – Track trends over time
* Bar Chart – Compare values across categories
* Stat Chart – Display key metrics at a glance
* Table – Present structured data in tabular form
* Gauge Chart – Show performance within a defined range
* Pie Chart – Visualize proportions of a whole
* Time Series Table – Combine tabular structure with time-based data

Each panel is powered by customizable queries and filters to give you full control over the insights you surface.
