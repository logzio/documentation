<h2 id="why">Why use dashboards?</h2>

With customizable visualizations and flexible querying capabilities, Logz.io dashboards help teams efficiently explore complex datasets, correlate events, and better understand their infrastructure. They allow you to:

* Visualize data from multiple sources in a single view.
* Detect anomalies and investigate issues in real time.
* Correlate metrics, logs, and traces for deeper analysis.
* Customize views to highlight the most relevant information for your team.

Your dashboards are built using panels and queries that display visualizations like time-series graphs, tables, and more. You can configure queries, filters, and layouts to tailor dashboards to your specific monitoring needs.

<h2 id="which">Which visualization can I create?</h2>

Unified Dashboards offer various panel types for you to choose from, including:

* Time Series Chart - Visualize data trends over time
* Bar Chart - Compare values across categories using bars
* Stat Chart - Show key statistics
* Table - Present data in tabular form.
* Gauge Chart - Show a single value within a range
* Pie Chart - Display proportions as slices of a circle
* Time Series Table - List time-stamped data in a table
