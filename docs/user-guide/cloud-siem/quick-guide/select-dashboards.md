By default, you will see the **Summary** dashboard when accessing your Cloud SIEM page. This dashboard shows you general information on your security events.

Cloud SIEM includes several dashboards dedicated specifically to a data source you may be using, and you can browse and view these dashboards.

In addition, you can request Logz.io to configure the default dashboard to your needs.

Sign into your Logz.io SIEM account and navigate to **[Dashboard](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/security/research/dashboards/list)**. 

Browse the list of available dashboards, and click on the one you'd like to view.

You can now view, analyze, and search the data according to your needs. To view your default dashboard, navigate back to Summary.
