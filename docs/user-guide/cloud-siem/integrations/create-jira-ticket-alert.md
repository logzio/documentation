You can configure your notification endpoints to automatically create JIRA tickets based on triggered alerts. 


### Pre-requisites

* Make sure that you have the required permissions to create a task in the required JIRA board.

* Create an API token for your [Atlassian account](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/).

* Convert the API token using the following command:

  ```shell
  echo -n <YOUR-EMAIL>:<YOUR-ATLASSIAN-API-TOKEN> | base64
  ```
  Replace `<YOUR-EMAIL>` with the email for your attlassian account and `<YOUR-ATLASSIAN-API-TOKEN>` with the API token for your Atlassian account.

### Add a JIRA notification endpoint


Navigate to your Logz.io [SIEM account > Settings > Notification endpoints](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/alerts/endpoints). 

Select **+ Add endpoint** to open the configuration wizard, and select **Custom**.

Next: 

* Name your endpoint and, if required, provide a description of the endpoint

* Provide the URL to your JIRA board as follows: `https://<tenantname>.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue`. Replace `<tenantname>` with the name of your JIRA domain stated before `.atlassian`

* Select **POST** from the **Method** menu

* Enter the following header into the **Headers** field: `authorization= Basic <API-TOKEN>`. Replace `<API-TOKEN>` with the API token to your Atlassian account

* Add the following code as the payload:

   ```json
   {
    "fields": {
        "project": {
            "key": <project board key>
        },
        "summary": "YOUR_SUMMARY",
        "issuetype": {
            "name": <board specific issue type>
        },
        "description": {
            "type": "doc",
            "version": 1,
            "content": [

                    "content": [
                        {
                            "type": "text",
                            "text": "YOUR_TEXT"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    }
    }
   ```
