Configure optimizers to store logs and aggregations to a timeless account for extended retention, retaining critical data for long-term visibility.


:::info note
You need a timeless account to configure optimizers. [Learn more](https://docs.logz.io/docs/user-guide/admin/logzio-accounts/manage-the-main-account-and-sub-accounts/) about timeless accounts. A log can take up to **2 hours** to appear in your timeless account.
:::

Open OpenSearch Dashboards and run your query of choice. 


Review the results in the histogram and the document table,
and make sure your query returns the expected results.
