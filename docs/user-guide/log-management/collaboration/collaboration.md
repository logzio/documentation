Logz.io offers several ways to collaborate data, dashboards, and insights. The popular options are:

1. [Share dashboards with colleagues or clients who don't have access to your Logz.io account](/docs/user-guide/log-management/collaboration/sharing-links/).
Populated dashboards can be shared as **snapshots** or **saved objects**, which include the associated logs. Snapshots are retained for 30 days and then automatically deleted.

2. [Share dashboards across accounts](/docs/user-guide/log-management/collaboration/share-import-export/). This option only migrates the dashboard structure. Logs are not included. If shared as a snapshot, the visual data is retained for 30 days, after which it is automatically deleted.


:::note
Visualizations and saved searches can be shared in similar ways. Wherever we refer to dashboards here, we do so for simplicity. Dashboards, visualizations, and saved searches are all OpenSearch Dashboards objects and offer many of the same sharing options.
