<h3>Upgrade your support plan</h3>

To do so, navigate to [Settings > Plans and Usage](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/plan-and-billing/plan) and upgrade your plan to a higher tier.

Your Logz.io subscription can include any combination of products (logs, metrics, traces, SIEM) and can be set as a monthly or annual plan to suit your needs.
