# Log Correlations


Your Metrics account offers several ways to correlate data between your Logz.io Infrastructure Monitoring and Log Management accounts:

1. Annotations can mark events on your Metrics dashboards based on data from a logging account. [Learn more about Annotations](/docs/user-guide/infrastructure-monitoring/log-correlations/annotations/).

2. Drill down links offer a quick way to get from an Infrastructure Monitoring metrics visualization to the relevant logs in Log Management. [Learn more about Explore in OpenSearch Dashboards links](/docs/user-guide/infrastructure-monitoring/log-correlations/explore-in-logs-drilldown-links/).
