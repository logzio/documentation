Logz.io Metrics solution is powered by Prometheus. This topic will help you get started with PromQL on Logz.io, and presents some examples and use cases for your environment.

:::note
PromQL does not support the `*` wildcard that Lucene queries use.
Instead, use `"~"` before the value you want to search, and `".+"` at the end of it.
:::

### Let's query

* To search all of the time series data points in your dashboard, run the following query:
`count({__name__=~".+"}) by (__name__)`

* To search for a specific time series point, add the relevant value to the query:
`{__name__=~"value.+"}`
    For example, to get all of the time series data points that starts with the value **container**, use the following query:<
`{__name__=~"container.+"}`

* Searching a label inside a time series changes the query. You need to add the name of the time series, and the value you're looking for:
`nameOfTimeSeries{label=~"value.+"}`

    For example, if the time series you're querying has the following labels:

    * namespace
    * container
    * pod
    * user

    To search for a namespace label that starts with **kub**, run the following query:
    `container_memory_working_set_bytes{namespace=~"kub.+"}`

### Metrics browser

* If you're not sure what metrics your dashboard contains, which labels it includes, or the values you can search for, click **Metrics browser** to view all of the data, and build the query that fits your needs.
