AI Agent is part of Logz.io's Observability IQ suite. It provides an AI-powered, chat-based interface that lets you engage in a dynamic conversation with your data. Use it to move beyond passive data viewing and get real-time insights about your metrics, anomalies, trends, and the overall health of your environment.

AI Agent is available in [Explore](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/explore), and as part of [Kubernetes 360](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/observability/k8s360), and [App 360](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/spm/service-overview).

The agent suggests a few queries you can run on your data to help you start the analysis and deep-dive, or you can type your own questions.

The answers are based on the data currently shown on your dashboard. Once you change the query, apply filters, or change the time period, any new answer from the agent will be based on the newly generated data. 

You can now leverage the insights from your dialog and enhance data analysis to make informed decisions.

## Using AI Agent

AI Agent is available in **[Explore](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/explore)**, **[Kubernetes 360](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/observability/k8s360)**, and **[App 360](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/spm/services/table)**. Click the AI Agent button at the top to open the interface.

Use the agent to analyze trends in latency, throughput, error rate, and HTTP status codes over time to identify patterns or anomalies that may require attention. Additionally, it can be used to compare the performance metrics of different operations and determine if any significant differences need to be addressed.

To get started with AI Agent, select one of the pre-built questions or type a custom query according to what you'd like to analyze.

_Once you provide input to the agent, the **dashboard's data** will be shared with Claude3._

## AI Agent Root Cause Analyzer

Logz.io's Root Cause Analyzer (RCA) leverages GenAI to diagnose the root causes of exceptions within applications. By analyzing context and data, RCA delivers deep insights and actionable recommendations, streamlining the troubleshooting process and accelerating root cause analysis.

RCA adapts dynamically to the specific context of each problem, functioning like a knowledgeable team member who understands the nuances of the issue and provides accurate and effective analysis.

It comprehends the situation, identifies the necessary information for thorough analysis, and proactively seeks the data required.
