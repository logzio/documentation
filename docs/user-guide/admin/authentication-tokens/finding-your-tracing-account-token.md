When you're setting up data shipping to your Distributed Tracing account, you'll need to include your Distributed Tracing shipping token. The token routes your data to the right account in Logz.io. 

Here's how to get the tracing token: 


### Via the Manage Tokens page

{@include: ../../../_include/general-shipping/manage-tokens-nav.md}

{@include: ../../../_include/general-shipping/data-shipping-tokens_vars.md}

### Via the Manage accounts page

{@include: ../../../_include/tracing-shipping/tracing-token.md}
