Logz.io supports multi-factor authentication for all users on a main account or sub account.
To enable this feature, an account admin needs to contact the Support team.

:::caution Important
All users in your account must have Google Authenticator installed on their phones to be able to sign in.
Logz.io emails users to tell them when multi-factor authentication is enabled.

### Request multi-factor authentication from Logz.io

<a class="intercom-launch" href="mailto:help@logz.io">Contact the Support team</a>.
Write that you want to enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).

MFA is applied to your main account and each sub account separately.
Include the last six digits of your [account token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts) for each account that you want MFA enabled on.

The Support team will tell you when multi-factor authentication is enabled.

### Enable MFA with QR code

Once Support enables MFA, log out of Logz.io.
The next time you log in, you'll see a QR code.

<!-- Do yourself a favor and scan the QR code in this image. You won't be disappointed. -->

### Activate multi-factor authentication

Scan the QR code using Google Authenticator, type your verification code, and click **Verify**.

In future logins, Logz.io will prompt you to enter your Google Authenticator verification code.
