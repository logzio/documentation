Logz.io supports Multi-Factor Authentication to enhance the security of your main and sub-accounts. This feature ensures an additional layer of protection for user access.

## Enabling Two-Factor Authentication

Only account **admins** can enable 2FA for an account. To enable it:

Navigate to **Settings > Account settings** and toggle the Two-Factor Authentication button to enable the feature.

Once enabled, all users in the account will receive an email notification informing them that the account has been configured for enhanced security. All users in the account will be required to set up 2FA during their next login.

:::caution Important
Every user in the account must have Google Authenticator installed to sign in.
Logz.io will notify users via email when 2FA is enabled for the account.

## Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication

When prompted:

* Open the **Google Authenticator** app on your phone.
* Scan the QR code displayed on the screen.
* Enter the verification code generated by the app.
* Click Verify to complete the setup.

For all future logins, youâ€™ll need to provide the verification code from Google Authenticator to access your account.

<!-- Do yourself a favor and scan the QR code in this image. You won't be disappointed. -->
