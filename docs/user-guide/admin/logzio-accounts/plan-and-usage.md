Logz.io provides built-in dashboards to help you track daily and monthly usage across Log Management, Infrastructure Monitoring, and Distributed Tracing. These dashboards help you monitor your consumption and anticipate when you're approaching your plan limits.

To access them, log in to your Logz.io account and navigate to [Settings > Plan and usage > Usage & Info](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/plan-and-billing/usage).

The dashboards on this page represent the different Logz.io products you use: Log Management, Infrastructure Monitoring, and Distributed Tracing.

Each dashboard corresponds to one of your active Logz.io products. Use the date picker to select a start date—data will be shown from that date through today. You can also toggle the Include sub accounts option to view usage across all associated accounts.

Each telemetry dashboard provides a high-level overview, including:

* Your current daily plan
* The number of days the plan was exceeded
* Total volume (GB) consumed beyond the plan

Below the summary, you'll find several charts that visualize usage across different scenarios—for example, main vs. sub account usage, consumption over retention days, and restored data (if available).

Charts display usage trends by day and split data between main and sub accounts. Hover over any column for more details, click a column to drill down by hour or week, and use the arrows in the top right to navigate between levels of detail.
