If blah blah blah

Purchase private offer - Customer someone spoke to and made a special offer based on the conversation (NetAPP), they do have the commitment and can’t stop when they want to. They pay a budget upfront (start date, end date, pay budget on day one). When there’s on demand they pay for it through AWS.


:::note
Custom offers are paid upfront and you cannot stop the contract or get money back.
