<h2 id="private">Custom AWS Plan</h2>

If your organization has specific needs, Logz.io offers custom AWS plans through private offers. These plans provide tailored pricing and contract terms, typically negotiated based on your expected usage.

How Private Offers Work:

* Fixed Commitment – Customers agree to a set budget and contract period.
* Upfront Payment – Payment is made at the start of the contract (fixed start and end dates).
* Additional Usage – Any usage beyond the committed budget is billed on-demand via AWS.

**Custom offers require upfront payment and cannot be canceled or refunded.**
