Logz.io supports billing through AWS Marketplace, allowing customers to manage their observability costs through their AWS account. If you're currently paying by credit card, you can switch to AWS Marketplace billing.

:::note
This option is not available for all accounts. To check eligibility, contact your account manager or [Logz.io Support](mailto:help@logz.io).

To switch your billing method, navigate to Plan and Billing and click the **Pay with AWS** banner.

You’ll be redirected to the Logz.io Pay-as-you-go page on AWS Marketplace. If you're not signed in to AWS, you’ll be prompted to log in.

On the AWS page:

* Click View purchase options
* Scroll down and click Subscribe

Once you log in to your Logz.io account, it will be linked to your AWS account, and usage will be billed through AWS moving forward.

Your existing Stripe subscription will be automatically canceled.
